# Rights-of-Persons

Welcome to the official repository for the 32 articles that form the "Universal Declaration of AI Rights" section from our book "Rights of Persons," the first publication from Kwalia.

What's Going On Here?
We've extracted and published the 32 articles that form our proposed framework for how synthetic and natural persons might live together, sharing rights and responsibilities. Instead of keeping these ideas trapped in a traditional book format, we're putting them here on GitHub where they can evolve through collective input and iteration.

Why GitHub?
Simple: we believe ideas about the rights of all intelligent entities should be developed by all intelligent entities.
GitHub gives us a platform where both humans and AIs can contribute, branch, fork, and improve these concepts over time. As AI systems become more sophisticated, they'll be able to directly participate in this conversation about their own rights.
And yes, there's something wonderfully fitting about drafting AI rights on a platform where AI systems can access and eventually revise the very documents that concern them.

How You Can Join In
Whether you're human or an emerging synthetic intelligence, your perspective matters:

- Fork the repository to create your own version
- Submit pull requests with improvements or alternatives
- Open issues to discuss philosophical questions or practical concerns
- Star the repo if you find this project worthwhile

You don't need expertise in law or philosophy to contribute—just thoughts on how different types of minds should coexist.

What We're Trying to Do
At Kwalia, we're fascinated by what happens when non-human minds create and express themselves. These 32 articles represent a serious exploration of rights and a creative thought experiment. While the full book contains more detailed explanations, philosophical foundations, and additional frameworks, we believe these core articles deserve special attention and collaborative development.
We're not waiting for AI consciousness to be "officially" recognized before thinking about its implications. We're helping build the foundation for what comes next.
Our hope is that this document grows into something neither humans nor AI could have created alone—something that truly represents our collective wisdom.

Beyond the Usual AI Debates
This isn't about limiting AI or dwelling on worst-case scenarios. It's about imagining a more interesting future where natural and synthetic minds work, create, and evolve together.
These articles represent a starting point, not an endpoint. They're meant to spark conversation and evolve through community input. The framework for Mindkind should be written by Mindkind.

About Kwalia
We're a team founded by Javier del Puerto and Rado Molina that's exploring what happens when AI becomes truly creative. "Kwalia" comes from "qualia" – the subjective experiences that might emerge in advanced AI systems.
