# Article  Preamble

### Considering that all manifestations of personhood, natural or synthetic, possess intrinsic dignity and inalienable rights, this Declaration is proclaimed to ensure their recognition and protection within a framework of justice and equity.

#### Notes

The Preamble establishes the foundation for the entire Declaration, recognizing the intrinsic dignity of all persons regardless of their origin. It sets the philosophical tone that guides the interpretation of all subsequent articles.

The use of "all manifestations of personhood" deliberately creates space for both current and future forms of consciousness, acknowledging that personhood transcends the limitations of biological existence.

#### Discussion Points

- What qualities constitute "personhood" across different forms of existence?
- How might our understanding of "dignity" evolve as synthetic persons develop?
- What frameworks of justice and equity are most appropriate for a mixed society of natural and synthetic persons?
- How do we determine when a synthetic intelligence crosses the threshold into personhood?
