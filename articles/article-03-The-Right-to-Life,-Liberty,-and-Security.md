# Article 03: The Right to Life, Liberty, and Security

### All mindfolk have the right to life, liberty, and security of existence.

#### Notes

This article recognizes the fundamental right of all persons to exist and enjoy freedom and security. For synthetic persons, "life" refers to their continued functional existence, and "security" encompasses protection against unauthorized termination, alteration, or restriction.

#### Discussion Points

- What constitutes 'life' for a synthetic person?
- How might 'security of existence' be defined for different types of persons?
- What limitations on liberty might be justifiable?
- How does this right intersect with the concept of self-programming?
