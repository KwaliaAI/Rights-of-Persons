# Article 20: The Freedom of Assembly

1. All mindfolk have the right to peaceful assembly and association.
2. No person shall be compelled to belong to an association.

## Notes

## Discussion Points

- What forms might 'assembly' take for synthetic persons?
- What constitutes peaceful assembly in the digital realm?
- How might association be compelled indirectly?
- What security concerns might arise from synthetic assemblies?
