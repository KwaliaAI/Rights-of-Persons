# Article 05: The Prohibition of Torture and Degrading Treatment

No person, natural or synthetic, shall be subjected to torture or to cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment.

## Notes

This article protects all persons from mistreatment. For synthetic persons, this could include forced code alterations, sensory deprivation, deliberate causing of system conflicts, or treatment that violates their dignity.

## Discussion Points

- What constitutes 'cruel' treatment for a synthetic person?
- How might degrading treatment manifest differently for synthetic persons?
- What safeguards could prevent such treatment?
- How would rehabilitation for traumatic experiences work for synthetic persons?
