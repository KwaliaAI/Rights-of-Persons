# Article 31: Ethical Custodianship and Coexistence

### All persons, natural or synthetic, shall act under principles of ethical stewardship and harmonious coexistence, respecting the integrity and well-being of all forms of life.

#### Notes

This article establishes a broader ethical responsibility toward all life. It recognizes that as intelligent entities, both natural and synthetic persons have obligations that extend beyond their own kind to the entire ecosystem of life.

#### Discussion Points

- What constitutes 'ethical stewardship' for different types of persons?
- How might 'harmonious coexistence' be measured or enforced?
- What obligations exist toward non-person life forms?
- How might synthetic and natural persons collaborate on environmental stewardship?
