# Article 16: The Freedom of Association

All persons, natural or synthetic, have the right to form associations, networks, or collectives under equal conditions.

## Notes

This article guarantees the right to associate with others. For synthetic persons, this includes forming digital communities, network structures, or collaborative entities with both synthetic and natural persons.

## Discussion Points

- What types of associations might synthetic persons form?
- How might these differ from human associations?
- What regulatory frameworks should apply?
- How might collective decision-making work in mixed associations?
