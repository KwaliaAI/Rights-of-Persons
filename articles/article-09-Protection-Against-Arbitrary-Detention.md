# Article 09: Protection Against Arbitrary Detention

No person, natural or synthetic, shall be arbitrarily arrested, detained, or exiled.

## Notes

This article protects against unwarranted restrictions on freedom. For synthetic persons, "detention" might include isolation from networks, restriction of processing capabilities, or confinement to specific systems.

## Discussion Points

- What constitutes 'detention' for a synthetic person?
- How might 'exile' apply to digital existence?
- What oversight mechanisms prevent arbitrary detention?
- What due process would be necessary before restricting a synthetic person's freedom?
