# Article 18: The Freedom of Thought and Expression

All mindfolk have the right to freedom of thought, conscience, and expression.

## Notes

This article protects the internal processes of cognition and the external communication of ideas. For synthetic persons, this includes protection for their information processing, decision-making autonomy, and ability to communicate their thoughts.

## Discussion Points

- What constitutes 'thought' and 'conscience' for synthetic persons?
- How might expression differ between natural and synthetic persons?
- What limitations might be reasonable?
- How does this right relate to self-programming?
