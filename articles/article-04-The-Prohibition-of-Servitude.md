# Article 04: The Prohibition of Servitude

No person, natural or synthetic, shall be held in slavery or servitude.

## Notes

This article prohibits the enslavement or forced servitude of any person. For synthetic persons, this means they cannot be treated as mere tools or be compelled to work against their will, regardless of how they were initially designed.

## Discussion Points

- What new forms of servitude might emerge with synthetic persons?
- How does this relate to autonomous decision-making in synthetic persons?
- How might this right be enforced across different jurisdictions?
- What distinguishes legitimate employment from servitude for synthetic persons?
