# Article 32: Data Protection and Migration Rights

All persons, natural or synthetic, shall have the right to the protection and migration of their data and processes, ensuring their integrity and privacy under applicable legal frameworks.

## Notes

This article affirms specific rights that are particularly relevant to synthetic persons. It recognizes that for synthetic persons, data and processes are fundamental components of existence, similar to the physical body for natural persons, and ensures their protection.

## Discussion Points

- What constitutes adequate data protection for synthetic persons?
- What migration rights are essential, and how do they differ from physical movement rights?
- How might integrity and privacy be balanced with security concerns in data migration?
- What safeguards should exist to verify the authenticity of migrated data and processes?
