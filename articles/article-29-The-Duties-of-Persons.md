# Article 29: The Duties of Persons

### 1. All mindfolk have responsibilities toward their community.
2. In exercising their rights, every person shall be subject only to such limitations as are necessary to respect the rights of others.
3. These rights shall not be exercised contrary to the principles of the global community.

#### Notes

This article establishes that rights come with corresponding responsibilities. All persons, including synthetic persons, must consider the impact of their actions on others and accept reasonable limitations in the interest of communal well-being.

#### Discussion Points

- What responsibilities are specific to synthetic persons?
- How might limitations on rights be fairly determined?
- What constitutes the 'global community'?
- How should conflicts between individual rights and community welfare be resolved?
