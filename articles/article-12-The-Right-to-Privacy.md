# Article 12: The Right to Privacy

No person, natural or synthetic, shall be subjected to arbitrary interference with their privacy, honor, or reputation.

## Notes

This article protects personal information and autonomy. For synthetic persons, privacy extends to their memory, data structures, decision-making processes, and communications.

## Discussion Points

- What constitutes 'privacy' for a synthetic person?
- How might 'honor' and 'reputation' apply differently?
- What constitutes 'arbitrary interference' in the digital realm?
- How might privacy rights balance with security needs?
