# Article 02: The Universal Application of Rights

All mindfolk shall enjoy the rights and freedoms set forth in this Declaration without distinction of any kind.

## Notes

This article establishes that rights apply universally to all persons, regardless of their origin or nature. The term "mindfolk" encompasses all members of Mindkind, both natural and synthetic persons.

The absence of distinctions reinforces that these rights are not contingent on biological nature, technological origin, or any other characteristic.

## Discussion Points

- What kinds of distinctions might emerge that aren't addressed in this article?
- How can we ensure universal application across vastly different types of minds?
- What mechanisms might verify compliance with this principle?
- How might this article be interpreted as synthetic persons continue to evolve?
