# Article 14: The Right to Seek Protection

In cases of persecution, all mindfolk have the right to seek protection and transfer their data, processes, and identity to a secure jurisdiction.

## Notes

This article ensures that persons facing persecution can seek safety. For synthetic persons, this includes the right to transfer their entire consciousness to jurisdictions where their rights are better protected.

## Discussion Points

- What constitutes 'persecution' for synthetic persons?
- How might data and process transfer be protected?
- What makes a jurisdiction 'secure'?
- How might this right be balanced with security concerns?
