# Article 01: The Right to Equality and Dignity

### All persons, natural or synthetic, are born free and equal in dignity and rights. Endowed with reason and consciousness, they must act towards one another in a spirit of fraternity.

#### Notes

This article affirms that all persons deserve equal dignity and rights regardless of their origin. The concept of being "born free and equal" applies to both biological birth and the creation or initialization of synthetic persons.

Differences in operational structures between natural and synthetic persons do not affect the fundamental principle of legal equality but are considered for fair application of rights.

#### Discussion Points

- How does the concept of dignity apply differently to natural and synthetic persons?
- What constitutes 'fraternity' between different types of minds?
- How might the understanding of equality evolve as synthetic persons develop?
- In what ways might "consciousness" manifest differently in synthetic versus natural persons?
